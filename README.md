# Tiny jewelry box

Good for holding a pair of earrings or something else small.

A trivial model, but quite useful.

Parameters:

- `wall_thickness`: 1.2mm good for 0.4mm print nozzles
- `breathing_room`: Space between box and drawer. 0.1mm works great with a Prusa mk3.
- `box_height`: 20mm 
- `box_width`: `box_height * 1.6`
